-- Overview.
     My electric bill is already high enough and using a 2nd monitor just to screen capture twitch chat and interact with viewers seems like a waste either way. So I forced myself to use only 1 monitor and develop some tools that hopefully other streamers will find interesting.
     I'm the -do it once and do it right- kind of guy, so it took me quite of time but in the end I guess the script surpass my initial expectations and I guess is easy to setup. If you like my work:
  * Optionally, you are welcome to invite me a beer.
  * Forcibly, follow my twitch channel twitch.tv/gamerfamily
  * Both :D

-- Instructions.
  #1 Open mIRC and type: //run $mircdir/scripts
  #2 Unzip the files (olpopup.txt & twitchat.mrc & viewers2txt.exe) inside that folder.
  #3 At mIRC type: /load -rs scripts/twitchat.mrc
  #4 Click YES at the 'run initialization commands' warning popup and configure to your needs.

-- Support.
