===Overview===
  My electric bill is already high enough and using a 2nd monitor just to screen capture twitch chat and interact with viewers didn't justify itself. So I forced myself to use only 1 monitor and develop some tools that hopefully other streamers will find interesting.

  I'm the -do it once and do it right- kind of guy, so it took me quite of time but in the end I guess the script surpass my initial expectations and I guess is easy to setup. If you like my work:
  * Optionally, you are welcome to invite me a beer.
  * Forcefully, follow my twitch channel http://twitch.tv/gamerfamily
  * Both :D
